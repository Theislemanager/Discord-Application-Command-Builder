# Discord-Application-Command-Builder
Discord Application Command Builder is a easy way to create, update or delete Slash Commands for your Discord bot.

**Copy index.php file to your webserver and start creating or editing your application commands**
*CURL needs to be enabled for this to work*

You can also use this website without hosting the file yourself: ![createcommands.app](https://createcommands.app/)
